# African Male YA Template Fix

While looking through the tuning files of the different templates a while back,
I made an interesting discovery: EA had set the template for YA African males to
use the Asian tag set (`TagSet_NPC_asian`). This can cause African YA sims
to spawn with items (and probably facial features) tagged as Asian.

This mod adjusts the template file, `template_youngadult_male_african.sim_template`,
to point to the African tag set (`TagSet_NPC_african`).
